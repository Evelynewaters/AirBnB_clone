# description of the project
Airbnb Clone Project - README.md Overview
The Airbnb Clone project features a console for managing objects, emphasizing a powerful storage system with file persistence. Models are kept independent, enabling seamless storage system replacement. The project supports file and database storage, currently focusing on JSON serialization for file storage. Instances are stored using a two-step process: conversion to serializable data structures and subsequent JSON representation. The use of *args and **kwargs allows flexible function parameter passing. The datetime module is employed for manipulating dates. The README offers a concise guide to project structure, storage, and key programming concepts, ensuring a modular and adaptable system.
